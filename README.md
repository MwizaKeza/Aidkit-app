## Installation
For this demo, we will be demonstrating the prototype on Android.

1. Install the latest version of Node.js.
2. Set up React Native environment using Expo Go. Follow the [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
3. Install Android Studio. Download it from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
4. Prepare your Android emulator or device. Follow the steps in this [guide](https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/download#:~:text=Set%20up%20an%20Android%20device%20emulator%20image,-To%20set%20up&text=In%20Android%20Studio%2C%20go%20to,it%20isn't%20already%20installed) or watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTNUpp72ik).
5. In the app directory, run the following commands in the terminal:
   - `npm install -g expo-cli`
   - `npm start`
   - This will start the Metro Bundler. It will download the Expo app on your emulator to host the app.
6. If you're using a physical device, download the Expo app manually. I suggest using the USB method as the QR code often fails.
7. Enter 'a' in the terminal to run the program on Android.
8. If you see "Android Bundling complete," you have successfully loaded the prototype.
